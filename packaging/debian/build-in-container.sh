#!/bin/bash
# Build and package fips inside the pinned build container. Run by
# build-deb-container.sh with the source at /src (read-only) and the cargo
# target directory in a named volume at /target; not meant to be run directly.
#
# Usage: build-in-container.sh --version V --output-dir DIR --name-file PATH
#                              [--features LIST]
#
# The target volume is shared by every checkout on the host. Cargo decides
# whether a workspace crate is up to date from file modification times, and a
# crate's artifacts carry no trace of which tree they came from, because every
# tree is mounted at the same /src. So a build of one tree whose files are
# older than another tree's last build links that tree's crates: it either
# fails to compile, when the root crate is rebuilt against another tree's
# member crate, or it packages the other tree's binary and says nothing. Four
# things here stop that:
#
#   1. A lock on the volume, held for the whole build and packaging, so two
#      package builds never interleave in it. It also covers the registry
#      volume: cargo keeps its own lock for the registry in CARGO_HOME, outside
#      that volume, so without this two containers can unpack the same crate at
#      once. Only builds that run this script take the lock.
#   2. The workspace crates are cleaned before every build, so they are always
#      compiled from this tree. Dependencies from the registry are keyed by
#      version, checksum, features and toolchain, so they stay cached and are
#      safe to share. This is what a repeat build pays for: the workspace
#      crates are compiled every time, about a minute, even when nothing
#      changed.
#   3. The build's own report is checked: a crate built from a path, rather
#      than downloaded, that cargo reports as fresh was not compiled here.
#   4. The binaries cargo left in the target volume are hashed after the build
#      and again after packaging, so a binary replaced in between, by a build
#      that does not take the lock, fails the build rather than shipping.
#
# After packaging, testing/check-deb-revision.sh checks that every binary in
# the package carries the revision and dirty flag of this tree, as git reads it
# here. That needs git here to read the tree's repository, which
# build-deb-container.sh arranges with its git mounts; HEAD is compared with the
# host's on entry so a gap in those mounts fails at once. A commit made in the
# tree while this build runs, including while it waits for the lock, fails the
# build: the package's version names one commit and its binaries may name
# another. Build again once the tree has settled.
